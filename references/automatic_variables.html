                        PowerShell presents a nested command prompt when you use the $Host.EnterNestedPrompt method. Windows
                        PowerShell also presents a nested command prompt when you reach a breakpoint in the Windows PowerShell
                        debugger. When you enter a nested prompt, Windows PowerShell pauses the current command, saves the
                        execution context, and increments the value of the $NestedPromptLevel variable. To create additional
                        nested command prompts (up to 128 levels) or to return to the original command prompt, complete the
                        command, or type "exit". The $NestedPromptLevel variable helps you track the prompt level. You can
                        create an alternative Windows PowerShell command prompt that includes this value so that it is always
                        visible. </td>
